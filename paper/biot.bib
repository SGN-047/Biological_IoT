  abstract = {Several applications, such as precision farming, military field monitoring and seismic activity monitoring require reliable and extended lifetime deployments of potentially a very large number of wireless sensor and actuator nodes. As hardware becomes cheaper and smaller, more of these applications are likely to appear, particularly as these miniaturised nodes offer the opportunity for the electronics to be embedded unobtrusively into everyday objects. This paper will present results from an EU funded project, PLANTS. PLANTS is a research project devising a novel technology that will allow plants to control their own environments. Using this technology, plant signals are detected, analysed and an appropriate response activated. The PLANTS system automatically responds to a plant's needs.},

  abstract = {Industry 4.0 aims to revolutionize the manufacturing sector to achieve sustainable and efficient production. The novel coronavirus pandemic has brought many challenges in different industries globally. Shortage in supply of raw material, changes in product demand, and factories closures due to general lockdown are all examples of such challenges. The adaption of Industry 4.0 technologies can address these challenges and prevent their recurrence in case of another pandemic outbreak in future. A prominent advantage of Industry 4.0 technologies is their capability of building resilient and flexible systems that are responsive to exceptional circumstances such as unpredictable market demand, supply chain interruptions, and manpower shortage which can be crucial at times of pandemics. This work focuses on discussing how different Industry 4.0 technologies such as Cyber Physical Systems, Additive Manufacturing, and Internet of Things can help the manufacturing sector overcome pandemics challenges. The role of Industry 4.0 technologies in raw material provenance identification and counterfeit prevention, collaboration and business continuity, agility and decentralization of manufacturing, crisis simulation, elimination of single point of failure risk, and other factors is discussed. Moreover, a self-assessment readiness model has been developed to help manufacturing firms determine their readiness level for implementing different Industry 4.0 technologies.},

In particular, body movement of a human conducting eurythmic dances near the plants (beetroots, tomatoes, lettuce) is correlated with the action potential measured by a plant SpikerBox, a device measuring the electrical activity of plants, and the leaf movement of the plant, tracked with a camera. The first experiment shows that our measurement system captures external stimuli identically for different plants, validating the measurement system. The second experiment illustrates that the plants' response is correlated to the movements of the dancer. The third experiment indicates that plants that have been exposed for multiple weeks to eurythmic dancing might respond differently to plants which are exposed for the first time to eurythmic dancing.},

S.W.A.M.P. projects attempt to find creative expression within elements of culture that are inherently counter-creative. The Bio-Fi series utilizes physical computing technology to access patterns and relationships surrounding a corporation, that couldn't be seen using any other medium. The field of 'biotelemetry' researches ways of gathering vital physiological data from living organisms through transponders (worn or implanted), which relay information to remote hardware [1]. With all biotelemetric applications, it is integral that the transponder-bearing subject is a synecdoche for its larger social group. In this respect, Bio-Fi projects are a sort of 'inverse-biotelemetry'. Test subjects are not released into a natural environment, but trapped within a synthetic environment whose conditions are tempered by various systems of information: Wi-Fi signals are like water, information mined from the internet is food, and electronic pulses become sunlight.},

We have extended this practice by combining living plants with sensors and lights in an interactive display, and by creating a robotic analogue that mimics phototropic behavior. In this paper, we document our design process and report the results of a 2-week field study. We put our living plant display, and its robotic counterpart, in a cafeteria between pairs of trash and recycling containers. Contributions of recyclables or trash triggered directional bursts of light that gradually induced the plant displays to lean toward the more active container. In interviews, people offered explanations for the displays and spoke of caring for the plants. A marginally significant increase in recycling behavior (p=.08) occurred at the display with living plants. Apparent increases also occurred at the robotic display and a unit with only lights. Our findings indicate value in exploring the use of living material and biomimetic forms in displays, and in using lightweight robotics to deliver simple rewards.},

To address this, we developed an open-source tool, the SpikerBox, which is appropriate for use in middle/high school educational programs and by amateurs. This device can be used in easy experiments in which students insert sewing pins into the leg of a cockroach, or other invertebrate, to amplify and listen to the electrical activity of neurons. With the cockroach leg preparation, students can hear and see (using a smartphone oscilloscope app we have developed) the dramatic changes in activity caused by touching the mechanosensitive barbs. Students can also experiment with other manipulations such as temperature, drugs, and microstimulation that affect the neural activity. We include teaching guides and other resources in the supplemental materials. These hands-on lessons with the SpikerBox have proven to be effective in teaching basic neuroscience.},

  abstract = {The nature has myriad plant organisms, many of them carrying unique sensing and expression abilities. Plants can sense the environment, other living entities and regenerate, actuate or grow in response. Our interaction mechanisms and communication channels with such organisms in nature are subtle, unlike our interaction with digital devices. We propose a new convergent view of interaction design in nature by merging and powering our electronic functionalities with existing biological functions of plants. Cyborg Botany is a design exploration of deep technological integration within plants. Each desired synthetic function is grown, injected or carefully placed in conjunction with a plant's natural functions. With a nanowire grown inside the xylem of a plant [1, 2, 3, 4], we demonstrate its use as a touch sensor, motion sensor, antenna and more. We also demonstrate a software through which a user clicks on a plant's leaves to individual control their movement [6], and explore the use of plants as a display [5]. Our goal is to make use of a plant's own sensing and expressive abilities of nature for our interaction devices. Merging synthetic circuitry with plant's own physiology could pave a way to make these lifeforms responsive to our interactions and their ubiquitous sustainable deployment.},
