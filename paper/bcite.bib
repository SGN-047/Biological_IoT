This work presents a novel method for interacting with and controlling a swarm of quadrotors in a confined space. EMG-based gesture control is used to control the position, orientation, and density of the swarm. Inter-agent as well as agent-operator collisions are prevented through a velocity controller based on a distance-based potential function. State feedback is relayed to the operator via a vibrotactile haptic vest. This cobot human swarm interface prioritizes operator safety while reducing the cognitive load during control of a cobot swarm. This work demonstrates that an operator can safely and intuitively control a swarm of aerial robots in the same workspace.},

A simple yet effective interface is maneuvered that can permit even amateur users to control a quadcopter. EMG signals were acquired using eight electrodes of MyoArm band while the subjects performed four different hand gestures to control the quadcopter in four different directions. Moreover, those signals were filtered to remove noises-the noise-free signal was then used to acquire features that could be used for classification of different hand gestures. After acquiring suitable features, linear discriminant analysis was used to classify and generate control commands to control the quadcopter. Results demonstrate the feasibility in using EMG to control a quadcopter effectively with little training.}

  abstract = {Robotic herding is expected to become a new technology for the management of grazing animals. We investigated the behavioral responses of cows to drone herding on consecutive days and the potential of this technology to manipulate grazing distribution in a pasture. A herd of {$\sim$}30 cows was stocked in a 1.1-ha pasture for 5 consecutive days each month from May to October 2022. The cows were herded using a drone for 10 days during the grazing period in August (days 1--5) and September (days 6--10). The pasture was divided into nine plots, with two and three plots assigned as the `herding area' in August and September, respectively. When the cows were grazing in the herding area, the operator maneuvered the drone to move the animals out of the area. The drone first approached at an altitude of 10\,m; if the cows did not move away, the altitude was gradually lowered to 3\,m. The behavioral responses to the drone, success or failure of herding (whether the cows left the area or not), and drone altitude were classified based on videos recorded during herding. The behavior and location of the cows in the pasture were observed during this period. The utilization rates of the plots (percentage of grazing time) were calculated to evaluate the effects of herding and the number of herding days. The cows responded in 59\% and 46\% of the cases on days 1 and 2, respectively. Startle behavior was recorded in 23\% of the responses on day 1. Herding was successful in 51--75\% of the cases on days 1--3. However, these percentages decreased thereafter. The utilization rate of the herding area on day 1 was approximately half that on days without herding. It increased from day 2, and almost no effect on grazing distribution was observed on or after day 3. These findings suggest that the cows exhibited little fear of drones after 1-day herding, and responses to the drones decreased as the animals subsequently became habituated to frequently repeated stimuli. Even after a 24-day interval, responsiveness to drone herding barely recovered and then declined. Therefore, drone herding was hardly effective in manipulating grazing distribution. Further investigation of stimulation that persistently elicits desirable responses is needed for future applications in technologies for the autonomous control of animal movement.},

  abstract = {Hand gestures are a form of non-verbal communication used by individuals in conjunction with speech to communicate. Nowadays, with the increasing use of technology, hand-gesture recognition is considered to be an important aspect of Human-Machine Interaction (HMI), allowing the machine to capture and interpret the user's intent and to respond accordingly. The ability to discriminate between human gestures can help in several applications, such as assisted living, healthcare, neuro-rehabilitation, and sports. Recently, multi-sensor data fusion mechanisms have been investigated to improve discrimination accuracy. In this paper, we present a sensor fusion framework that integrates complementary systems: the electromyography (EMG) signal from muscles and visual information. This multi-sensor approach, while improving accuracy and robustness, introduces the disadvantage of high computational cost, which grows exponentially with the number of sensors and the number of measurements. Furthermore, this huge amount of data to process can affect the classification latency which can be crucial in real-case scenarios, such as prosthetic control. Neuromorphic technologies can be deployed to overcome these limitations since they allow real-time processing in parallel at low power consumption. In this paper, we present a fully neuromorphic sensor fusion approach for hand-gesture recognition comprised of an event-based vision sensor and three different neuromorphic processors. In particular, we used the event-based camera, called DVS, and two neuromorphic platforms, Loihi and ODIN + MorphIC. The EMG signals were recorded using traditional electrodes and then converted into spikes to be fed into the chips. We collected a dataset of five gestures from sign language where visual and electromyography signals are synchronized. We compared a fully neuromorphic approach to a baseline implemented using traditional machine learning approaches on a portable GPU system. According to the chip's constraints, we designed specific spiking neural networks (SNNs) for sensor fusion that showed classification accuracy comparable to the software baseline. These neuromorphic alternatives have increased inference time, between 20 and 40\%, with respect to the GPU system but have a significantly smaller energy-delay product (EDP) which makes them between 30{\texttimes} and 600{\texttimes} more efficient. The proposed work represents a new benchmark that moves neuromorphic computing toward a real-world scenario.},

Armbands capable of surface electromyography (sEMG) are attractive and noninvasive devices from which human intent can be derived by leveraging machine learning.

The proposed system is compared with the Myo Armband by Thalmic Labs, one of the most popular sEMG acquisition systems. The comparison is made by employing a new offline dataset featuring 22 able-bodied participants performing eleven hand/wrist gestures while wearing the two armbands simultaneously. The 3DC Armband systematically and significantly (    p {$<$} 0.05    ) outperforms the Myo Armband, with three different classifiers employing three different input modalities when using ten seconds or more of training data per gesture.

Subsequently, the most attractive techniques are evaluated and compared by highlighting their most relevant features. This is motivated by the gradual growth of swarm robotics solutions in situations where conventional search cannot find a satisfactory solution. For instance, exhaustive multi-robot search techniques, such as sweeping the environment, allow for a better avoidance of local solutions but require too much time to find the optimal one. Moreover, such techniques tend to fail in finding targets within dynamic and unstructured environments. This paper presents experiments conducted to benchmark five state-of-the-art algorithms for cooperative exploration tasks. The simulated experimental results show the superiority of the previously presented Robotic Darwinian Particle Swarm Optimization (RDPSO), evidencing that sociobiological inspiration is useful to meet the challenges of robotic applications that can be described as optimization problems (e.g.,~search and rescue). Moreover, the RDPSO is further compared with the best performing algorithms within a population of 14 e-pucks. It is observed that the RDPSO algorithm converges to the optimal solution faster and more accurately than the other approaches without significantly increasing the computational demand, memory and communication complexity.},

This problem has potential applications in the context of the manipulation of the swarm of micro- and nano-particles. We first formulate the separation problem, where the swarm agents (called sheep) are modeled by the Boid model. We then analytically study the special case of two-sheep swarms. By leveraging the analysis, we then propose a potential function-based movement algorithm of the shepherd to achieve separation while maintaining the connectivity within the remaining swarm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with numerical simulations.},

This paper presents a controller designed that can be easily fitted to a band on the user's arm. It is composed by inertial (gyroscope, accelerometer) and electromyographic sensors, that will measure the muscle movements and construe them in references for the drone. Gesture recognition is achieved using an Artificial Neural Network to fully exploit the capabilities of both, the user and UAV - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. UAV chosen to test with the controller is a quadcopter. The comparative results show the compactness and easy-to-handle interface that allows even inexperienced users, to intuitively have control over remote-controlled objects as compared to a standard remote controller.}

The first experiment shows that our measurement system captures external stimuli identically for different plants, validating the measurement system. The second experiment illustrates that the plants' response is correlated to the movements of the dancer.

  abstract = {Bio-Fi is a collection of art projects undertaken by S.W.A.M.P. (Studies of Work Atmospheres and Mass Production), collaborative art projects by Douglas Easterly and Matt Kenyon. S.W.A.M.P. projects attempt to find creative expression within elements of culture that are inherently counter-creative. The Bio-Fi series utilizes physical computing technology to access patterns and relationships surrounding a corporation, that couldn't be seen using any other medium. The field of 'biotelemetry' researches ways of gathering vital physiological data from living organisms through transponders (worn or implanted), which relay information to remote hardware [1]. With all biotelemetric applications, it is integral that the transponder-bearing subject is a synecdoche for its larger social group. In this respect, Bio-Fi projects are a sort of 'inverse-biotelemetry'. Test subjects are not released into a natural environment, but trapped within a synthetic environment whose conditions are tempered by various systems of information: Wi-Fi signals are like water, information mined from the internet is food, and electronic pulses become sunlight.},

  abstract = {A robotic swarm can perform various tasks. However, a human is required to task the swarm. Human control over the swarm can be enabled through a set of influential agents which can be either leaders or predators. In the presence of multiple tasks, the swarm may need to split into sub-swarms to accomplish the task and re-group as a swarm to execute larger tasks. The response of the swarm in the presence of influential agents depends on the swarm dynamics. A precise measure of influence using leaders or predators or a combination of leaders and predators to achieve the mission is not adequately studied. In this paper, we analyze the effect of using only leaders, only predators and a combination of leaders and predators on three swarm models namely, shepherding model, Couzin's model and a physicomimetic models while they perform foraging tasks and carry out Monte-Carlo simulations to evaluate the performance of the influential agents on different swarms. We also propose a novel way to split a swarm into smaller sub-swarms using influential agents. Our results show that the predator based swarm splitting and steering to a task based on shepherding model performs far better than any other combination of leaders and predators. This result is consistent even when the number of agents is increased to 500.},

In this paper, we document our design process and report the results of a 2-week field study. We put our living plant display, and its robotic counterpart, in a cafeteria between pairs of trash and recycling containers. Contributions of recyclables or trash triggered directional bursts of light that gradually induced the plant displays to lean toward the more active container. In interviews, people offered explanations for the displays and spoke of caring for the plants. A marginally significant increase in recycling behavior (p=.08) occurred at the display with living plants. Apparent increases also occurred at the robotic display and a unit with only lights. Our findings indicate value in exploring the use of living material and biomimetic forms in displays, and in using lightweight robotics to deliver simple rewards.},

  abstract = {The Starling Formation-Flying Optical Experiment (StarFOX) is intended as the first on-orbit demonstration of autonomous distributed angles-only navigation for spacecraft swarms. StarFOX applies the angles-only Absolute and Relative Trajectory System (ARTMS), a navigation architecture consisting of three innovative algorithms: image processing, which identifies and tracks multiple targets in images from a single camera without a priori relative orbit knowledge; batch orbit determination, which autonomously initializes orbit estimates for visible swarm members; and sequential orbit determination, which continuously refines the swarm state by fusing measurements from multiple observers exchanged over an intersatellite link. Nonlinear dynamics and measurement models provide sufficient observability to estimate absolute orbits, relative orbits, and auxiliary states using only bearing angles without maneuvers. StarFOX will be conducted using a four-CubeSat swarm as part of the NASA Starling mission, and simulations of experiment scenarios demonstrate that ARTMS meets mission performance requirements. Results indicate that mean bearing angle errors are below 35{$\prime\prime$} (1{$\sigma$}), initial target range errors are below 20\% of true separation, and steady-state range errors are below 2\% (1{$\sigma$}). Absolute orbit estimation accuracy is on the order of 100 m. Hardware-in-the-loop tests display robust navigation under a variety of conditions, enabling autonomous, ubiquitous navigation with minimal ground interaction for future distributed missions.},

In this paper, we particularly focus on the motion control of the barking drones. To this end, a computationally efficient sliding mode based control algorithm is developed, which navigates the drones to track the moving boundary of the animals' footprint and enables the drones to avoid collisions with others. Extensive computer simulations, where the dynamics of the animals follow Reynolds' rules, show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

The main objective of this endeavor is the development an intelligent interface that allows the user to control the flight of a drone beyond direct manual control. The biosensors used in this work were the MyoWare Muscle sensors which contain two EMG electrodes and were used to collect signals from the posterior (extensor) and anterior (flexor) forearm, and the bicep. The collection of the raw signals from each sensor were performed using an Arduino Uno. Data processing algorithms were developed with the purpose of classifying the signals generated by the arm's muscles when performing specific movements, namely: flexing, resting, arm-up, and arm motion from right to left. With these arm motions, roll control of the drone was achieved. MATLAB software was utilized to condition the signals and prepare them for the classification stage. To generate the input vector for the ANN and perform the classification, the root mean squared, and the standard deviation were processed for the signals from each electrode. The neuromuscular information was trained using an ANN with a single 10 neurons hidden layer to categorize the four targets. The result of the classification shows that an accuracy of 97.5\% was obtained for a single user. Afterwards, classification results were used to generate the appropriate control signals from the computer to the drone through a Wi-Fi network connection. These procedures were successfully tested, where the drone responded successfully in real time to the commanded inputs.},

Plants can sense the environment, other living entities and regenerate, actuate or grow in response. Our interaction mechanisms and communication channels with such organisms in nature are subtle, unlike our interaction with digital devices. We propose a new convergent view of interaction design in nature by merging and powering our electronic functionalities with existing biological functions of plants. Cyborg Botany is a design exploration of deep technological integration within plants. Each desired synthetic function is grown, injected or carefully placed in conjunction with a plant's natural functions. With a nanowire grown inside the xylem of a plant [1, 2, 3, 4], we demonstrate its use as a touch sensor, motion sensor, antenna and more. We also demonstrate a software through which a user clicks on a plant's leaves to individual control their movement [6], and explore the use of plants as a display [5]. Our goal is to make use of a plant's own sensing and expressive abilities of nature for our interaction devices. Merging synthetic circuitry with plant's own physiology could pave a way to make these lifeforms responsive to our interactions and their ubiquitous sustainable deployment.},

However, the step to industrial applications has not yet been made successfully. Literature is light on real-world swarm applications that apply actual swarm algorithms. Typically, only parts of swarm algorithms are used which we refer to as basic swarm behaviors. In this paper we collect and categorize these behaviors into spatial organization, navigation, decision making, and miscellaneous. This taxonomy is then applied to categorize a number of existing swarm robotic applications from research and industrial domains. Along with the classification, we give a comprehensive overview of research platforms that can be used for testing and evaluating swarm behavior, systems that are already on the market, and projects that target a specific market. Results from this survey show that swarm robotic applications are still rare today. Many industrial projects still rely on centralized control, and even though a solution with multiple robots is employed, the principal idea of swarm robotics of distributed decision making is neglected. We identified mainly following reasons: First of all, swarm behavior emerging from local interactions is hard to predict and a proof of its eligibility for applications in an industrial context is difficult to provide. Second, current communication architectures often do not match requirements for swarm communication, which often leads to a system with a centralized communication infrastructure. Finally, testing swarms for real industrial applications is an issue, since deployment in a productive environment is typically too risky and simulations of a target system may not be sufficiently accurate. In contrast, the research platforms present a means for transforming swarm robotics solutions from theory to prototype industrial systems.},

We present the results of a meta-analysis of nine scientific papers published in the ACM DL and IEEE Xplore databases. Our findings show that research on human-drone swarm interaction shows a disproportionate interest in hand gestures compared to other input modalities for drone swarm control. Furthermore, all articles reviewed exclusively explored gestures and the size of the swarm used in the studies was limited, with a median of 3.0 and an average of 3.8 drones per study. We compiled an inventory of interaction modalities, recognition techniques, and application types from the scientific literature, which is presented in this paper. On the basis of our findings, we propose four areas for future research that can guide scientific investigations and practical developments in this field.},

This technology has already been applied in scenarios such as prosthetic design, assisted robot control, and rehabilitation training. This article provides an overview of sEMG-based robot control, covering two important aspects: (1) sEMG signal processing and classification methods and (2) robot control strategies and methods based on sEMG. First, the article outlines the general steps in sEMG signal processing and summarizes the commonly used methods for data acquisition, pre-processing, and feature extraction. In addition, machine-learning-based pattern recognition methods have been introduced for sEMG signal classification. Subsequently, user intent-based robot control strategies are classified into three categories: full-human continuous control, semi-autonomous continuous control, and discrete control, and their control methods and applicable scenarios are compared. Finally, this article discusses the advantages, disadvantages, and future development prospects of sEMG-based robot control. This review provides a comprehensive overview of sEMG-based robot control, from signal processing and classification methods to robot control strategies and methods, aiming to guide future research on selecting filters, feature sets, and pattern recognition methods and to assist in establishing sEMG-driven robot control frameworks.},

  abstract = {Many applications benefit from the use of multiple robots, but their scalability and applicability are fundamentally limited when relying on a central control station. Getting beyond the centralized approach can increase the complexity of the embedded software, the sensitivity to the network topology, and render the deployment on physical devices tedious and error-prone. This work introduces a software-based solution to cope with these challenges on commercial hardware. We bring together our previous work on Buzz, the swarm-oriented programming language, and the many contributions of the Robotic Operating System (ROS) community into a reliable workflow, from rapid prototyping of decentralized behaviors up to robust field deployment. The Buzz programming language is a hardware independent, domain-specific (swarm-oriented), and composable language. From simulation to the field, a Buzz script can stay unmodified and almost seamlessly applicable to all units of a heterogeneous robotic team. We present the software structure of our solution, and the swarm-oriented paradigms it encompasses. While the design of a new behavior can be achieved on a lightweight simulator, we show how our security mechanisms enhance field deployment robustness. In addition, developers can update their scripts in the field using a safe software release mechanism. Integrating Buzz in ROS, adding safety mechanisms and granting field updates are core contributions essential to swarm robotics deployment: from simulation to the field. We show the applicability of our work with the implementation of two practical decentralized scenarios: a robust generic task allocation strategy and an optimized area coverage algorithm. Both behaviors are explained and tested with simulations, then experimented with heterogeneous ground-and-air robotic teams.},

A new Competitive Coevolutionary Genetic Algorithm (CompCGA) is proposed to optimise the vehicles' parameters and escapers' evasion ability using a predator-prey approach. Our results show that CROMM-MS is not only viable for surveillance tasks but also that its results are competitive in regard to the state-of-the-art approaches.},

While Cassini-Huygens has made big surprises in revealing Titan's organically rich environment and Enceladus' cryovolcanism, the mission's success naturally leads us to further probe these findings. We advocate the acknowledgement of Titan and Enceladus science as highly relevant to ESA's long-term roadmap, as logical follow-on to Cassini-Huygens. In this White Paper, we will outline important science questions regarding these satellites and identify the science themes we recommend ESA cover during the Voyage 2050 planning cycle. Addressing these science themes would make major advancements to the present knowledge we have about the Solar System, its formation, evolution, and likelihood that other habitable environments exist outside the Earth's biosphere.},

  abstract = {The Age-of-Information (AoI) metric has been widely studied in the theoretical communication networks and queuing systems literature. However, experimental evaluation of its applicability to complex real-world time-sensitive systems is largely lacking. In this work, we develop, implement, and evaluate an AoI-based application layer middleware that enables the customization of WiFi networks to the needs of time-sensitive applications. By controlling the storage and flow of information in the underlying WiFi network, our middleware can: (i) prevent packet collisions; (ii) discard stale packets that are no longer useful; and (iii) dynamically prioritize the transmission of the most relevant information. To demonstrate the benefits of our middleware, we implement a mobility tracking application using a swarm of UAVs communicating with a central controller via WiFi. Our experimental results show that, when compared to WiFi-UDP/WiFi-TCP, the middleware can improve information freshness by a factor of 109x/48x and tracking accuracy by a factor of 4x/6x, respectively. Most importantly, our results also show that the performance gains of our approach increase as the system scales and/or the traffic load increases.},

Rather than immediately try to shrink or `bridge the gap' anytime a real-world experiment failed that worked in simulation, we characterize conditions under which this is actually necessary. When these conditions are not satisfied, we show how very simple simulators can still be used to both (i) design new multi-robot systems, and (ii) guide real-world swarming experiments towards certain emergent behaviors when the gap is very large. The key ideas are an iterative simulator-in-the-design-loop in which real-world experiments, simulator modifications, and simulated experiments are intimately coupled in a way that minds the gap without needing to shrink it, as well as the use of minimally viable phase diagrams to guide real world experiments. We demonstrate the usefulness of our methods on deploying a real multi-robot swarm system to successfully exhibit an emergent milling behavior.},
